###--- Notes on Deploying Applications with Docker Compose ---###
_________________________________________________________________

0) Basics:
----------

  - deploy multi-container applications with Docker Compose
  - similar to Docker Stacks, but uses nodes in 'single engine mode'
  - most apps made of 'microservices', multiple small services
  - describe app in single declarative configuration file and single commands

1) Background:
--------------

  - formerly known as Fig
  - external python binary package
  - define multi-container apps in YAML file

2) Linux Install:
-----------------

  * latest package at time of writing, check latest release on Github
  - curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.25.5/docker-compose-`uname -s`-`uname -m` -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
  - chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

3) Compose files:
-----------------

  - uses YAML files (YAML is subset of JSON, could use JSON)
  - default name is docker-compose.yml
  - use `-f` flag to give custome filename
  - four (of many) top level keys:
    1) version - mandatory, defines Compose file format (normally use latest)
    2) services - define different app services, each deployed as container
      a) build: . - build image using Dockerfile in cwd
      b) command - defines a main application for the container, which must exist in the image
      c) ports - map container port (target) to host (published)
      d) networks - which network to attach service to, should already exist or be defined in top level
      e) volumes - mount service volume (source) to /code (target) inside container
    3) networks - instructions to create new networks (normally 'bridge', use driver property to specify)
    4) volumes - instructions to create new volumes
